# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs preserve the **why** behind load-bearing technical decisions: the kind that survive rewrites and need to make sense to a reader years later. Feature docs and conventions describe the _what_; ADRs describe the _why we chose this what_.

When to write a new one:

- A non-obvious technical choice with viable alternatives that someone might later question or try to reverse.
- A decision that constrains future code.
- A pattern adoption that reaches across multiple modules.
- **A new library, a new third-party service, or a major version bump: always.** These are Tural's gate: the one-screen comparison table (options × what it buys × what it costs × the recommendation) goes to him in-session, or onto the issue as the decision note when he is not in session, and **that table is what lands in the record's _Alternatives considered_ section**. Writing it down is what stops the next session re-litigating the same debate. A major bump counts because a major version is a new set of behaviours under an old name.

When **not** to write one:

- Conventions that are obvious from the code (naming, folder layout): those go in [conventions.md](../conventions.md) if anywhere.
- One-off implementation details with no architectural reach.
- Version bumps with no semantic impact.

## Index

No records yet. Decisions taken before this record existed live on issue #1 (Architecture decision log) and in [stack.md](../stack.md).

| #   | Title | Status |
| --- | ----- | ------ |

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN. <Short title in title case>

- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by NNNN | Deprecated
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What forces are at play? What problem are we solving? What constraints exist? Cite specific incidents or pain points if they drove the decision.

## Decision

The rule we adopted, stated as a positive directive ("We do X"). Be precise enough that a reader can apply the rule in a new situation.

## Consequences

What changes because of this decision? What's now easier? What's now harder? What follow-up work or future risks does this create?

## Alternatives considered

Other options on the table and why they lost. This is what stops the next person from re-litigating the same debate, and for a library, service, or major bump it is where the comparison table Tural saw lands.

Numbering is **gap-free**, starting at `0001`. If a record is superseded, **leave it in place** and mark its status: never renumber, and never reuse a number.

Filenames are `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, and every new record is added to the index table above in the same commit.
