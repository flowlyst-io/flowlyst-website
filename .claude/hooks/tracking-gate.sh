# Gate: tracking-gate (deny-once)
# flowlyst-website: copied from Huella's tracking-gate.sh (itself first rendered
# from the Codery enforcement-gate scaffold @ 0.1.0), then hand-maintained here.
# Edits against Huella's copy: this header; the deny message cites this repo's
# CLAUDE.md section; the scope check compares repositories (git common dir), not
# paths, so a session working in a git worktree of this repo is gated.
#
# PreToolUse hook on Bash. Reads the tool call from stdin, acts only on
# commands matching the gate's pattern, and enforces the repo's rule:
# every PR references its GitHub issue (CLAUDE.md, Workflow).
# Every decision is appended to .codery/telemetry/gates.jsonl (gitignored).
#
# Accepted gaps (per the enforcement-gate manifest): a body passed via
# -F <file> is uninspectable from the command string; any "#<digits>"
# occurrence passes, even a spurious one; a command string merely
# mentioning "gh pr create" (e.g. inside an echo) trips the deny-once.
# Scope: the gate acts when the command's repository (git common dir) is the
# session's project repository, so the main checkout and every worktree of it
# are in scope and an unrelated repo is not. Only a "cd" that opens the command
# is followed; "git -C <dir>" and a later "cd" are not.
# The deny-once authorization is keyed per session AND per exact command
# string, so a bypass frees only the command that was denied; commands
# differing by so much as whitespace are distinct. Where no digest tool is
# reachable the key degrades to a bounded builtin fingerprint (length plus the
# first and last 20 alphanumerics), which can in principle collide and so let
# one other command through on a bypass — never a whole session's worth.
#
# Fail-open by construction: every error path exits 0 and stdout stays empty
# unless the gate has actually decided to deny.
